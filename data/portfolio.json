I enjoy building hands-on systems at the intersection of hardware and software, with a focus on practical, well-designed solutions.\n\nOutside of engineering, I love spending time outdoors—especially at the beach—playing video games with my family, reading, and hanging out with my French bulldogs. I’m curious by nature, detail-oriented, and always excited to learn something new.",
